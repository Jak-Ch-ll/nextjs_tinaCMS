# A Next.js and TinaCMS blog

This project is a continuation of [Next.js and EditorJS CMS](https://github.com/Jak-Ch-ll/editor_cms). While working on it, I found out about Tina and after fiddeling a bit with it, decided, I would switch the architecture of my project from a seperate CMS to a build in one.

## Technologies and reasons
- [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/)
  - after trying it out, I thought it's possible to implement and the idea of a build-in CMS looks much more user-friendly
* [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
  * No real reason, I just wanna use next more in the future, so I thought why not start now
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * My frontend framework of choice at the moment
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  * My database of choice at the moment
* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  * During testing a tried a few orms but got stuck with this one
  * Quite easy to use after a bit of setup
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
  * I started to learn TDD and want to use it in practice
